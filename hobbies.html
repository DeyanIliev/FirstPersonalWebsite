    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <ol> <!--Ordered list-->
      <li>Programming</li>
      <p>I have a little bit of knowledge in Python, Java and now in HTML, CSS and JS.
         It is <em>fascinating</em> to see how your creation little by little is coming alive, just by typing on a keyboard and learning something new everyday.</p>

          will revolutionize the way we learn." - Steve Jobs</em></p>

      <li>Videogames</li>
      <p>Sometimes, like every other human being I want to escape the real world by playing videogames on PC/Playstation. I love RPG and survival.</p>

      <li>Memes</li>
      <p>I love to spoil myself by watching memes, lying in bed and laughing like a little kid.</p>
